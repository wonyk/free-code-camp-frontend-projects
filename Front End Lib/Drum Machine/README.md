## Acknowledgements

As usual, I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides which often serve as both a refresher and a great learning resource.

Next, I am grateful to Astigmatic for designing the beautiful [McLaren](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/McLaren) cursive font while hosted in Google Fonts.

Moreover, thanks to [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) for their concise and compact cheatsheet to aid me in learning the basics of Grid CSS.

Furthermore, [React](https://reactjs.org/) has done extraordinarily in maintaining great documentation of their product, allowing me to get onto React swiftly.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers, which is done automatically through [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) in VSCode.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 71.0+ (beta), Chrome 77+, Edge 44+ and above (in terms of css).

The CSS has a minimum theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

For CSS Grid, these are theoretical support from MDN website:

- Chrome 57.0+
- Edge 16.0+
- Firefox 52.0+
- Opera 44+
- Safari 10+

Internet Explorer is not supported due to the usage of Grid layout in CSS.

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
