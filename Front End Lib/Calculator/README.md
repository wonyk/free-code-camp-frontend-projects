# Basic & Simple Calculator

This Github repo is a online calculator. It is done as a task for Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Project #4.

It has fulfilled all the requirements of the [Free Code Camp Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

## Acknowledgements

As usual, I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides which often serve as both a refresher and a great learning resource.

Additionally, a big thank you to the Stack Overflow community to enlighten me on some of the tricky questions I (and many others too!) encounted while doing this project. They have saved me a lot of valuable time while the exposure to various answers exposed me to multiple solutions.

Next, I am grateful to Steve Matteson for designing the wonderful [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font - which is hosted in Google Fonts.

Moreover, thanks to [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for their flexbox cheatsheet to aid me in utilising the flex box technology to the fullest.

Furthermore, [React](https://reactjs.org/) has done extraordinarily in maintaining great documentation of their product, allowing me to experiment and learn React swiftly.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 72.0+ (beta), Chrome 78+, Edge 44+, IE11 and above (in terms of css).

The CSS has a minimum theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
