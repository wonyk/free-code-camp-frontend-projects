## Introduction

To begin, simply:
- Edit the text on the left
- See the changes live on the right
- Refer to the cheatsheet below to start your Markdown journey!

## Markdown Cheatsheet
Some **great** things you can do in Markdown include **bolding** and _italicised_ texts. Perhaps even **_both_**!

Here is a list of commonly used ones:
1. Adding some `<code></code>` to your Markdown

2. Maybe even a chunk of code
    ```javascript
    const helloWorld = () => {
      console.log('Hello World!)
    }
    ```

3. Or perhaps a quote by Jonas Salk:
    > The reward for work well done is
    > the opportunity to do more

4. Nesting
	- Not in this either
		- Definitely not so shallow
			- You found me!

5. Moreover, if ~~cancellations are your favourite~~

6. Maybe even some [inline text link](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for some Markdown guide.

7. Tables are also exclusive to Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM):
    No. | First | Last | Present
    -- | -- | -- | --
    1 | John | Dow | Y
    2 | Mark | Leo | N

8. What about some shopping lists?
  - [ ] Apples
  - [ ] Oranges
  - [x] Pear

9. Lastly, include any image of your liking:
