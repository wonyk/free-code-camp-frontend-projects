# Simple Markdown Previewer

This Github repo is a Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) Previewer. Tt is done as a task for Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Project #2.

It has fulfilled all the requirements of the [Free Code Camp Build a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides.

Next, thanks to [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/#/README.md) for their wonderful library to help me parse Markdown into valid HTML.

Also, twitter [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has been a joy to use due to its simplicity and speed in which I can prototype and have a beautiful interface while using minimal effort to get the CSS right.

Furthermore, I appreciate Github for their clean and intuitive [PDF guide](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) on their own Markdown flavouring.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 71.0+ (beta), Chrome 77+, Edge 44+ and above (in terms of css).

The CSS has a theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

For Javascript, these are theoretical support from MDN website:
- Chrome 42+
- Edge 14+
- Firefox 39+
- Opera 29+
- Safari 10.1+

However, all versions of IE are unfortunately not supported. Fetch API is used and IE will not be supported.

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
