# Random Quote Generator

This Github repo is a random quote generator created by myself. Tt is done as a task for Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Project.

It has fulfilled all the requirements of the [Free Code Camp Quote Generator task](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides.

Also, I would like to thank Vernon Adams for the wonderful Pacifico font as well as Christian Robertson for the beautiful matching Roboto font, both of which are hosted on Google Fonts.

Next, thanks to [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) as well as [jQuery official documnetation](https://api.jquery.com/). Without them, this is definitely not possible.

Furthermore, thanks to [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) for the attractive looking Open Sourced twitter and refresh logos.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 70.0+ (beta), Chrome 77+, Edge 44+ and above (in terms of css).

The CSS has a theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

However, all versions of IE are unfortunately not supported. There are various problems of jQuery and flexbox support in IE, thus I did not extend support to IE.

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
