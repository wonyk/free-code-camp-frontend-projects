# Tomato Pomodoro

This Github repo is a Pomodoro Timer. It is done as a task for Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Project #5.

It has fulfilled all the requirements of the [Free Code Camp Build a Pomodoro Clock](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock).

## Acknowledgements

To start off, I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides which serve as a great learning resource. Their clear and concise documentation has helped me to consistently complete the various FCC tasks.

Next, I am grateful to Santiago Orozco for designing the perfect [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans) font and Matt McInerney for the [Orbitron font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron) which is primarily used for the digital timer. They are both hosted on Google Fonts.

Furthermore, [React's](https://reactjs.org/) team's effort in the countless updates to maintain and perfect new methods to make code cleaner such as the use of Hooks. I have utilised them in this project, opposed to the resources in FCC which utilised classes.

Moreover, I am once again thankful for the beautiful [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) designed by the Ionic team. They allowed me to greatly improve the User Interface effortlessly.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 72.0+ (beta), Chrome 79+, Edge 44+, IE11 and above (in terms of css and functionality).

The CSS has a minimum theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
