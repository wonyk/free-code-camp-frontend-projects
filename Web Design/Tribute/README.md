Next, I would also like to thank [w3schools How To](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp) for their wonderful tutorials which provided inspiration for the timeline designs and parallax effect in this project.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for helping to make my page work on more browsers.
