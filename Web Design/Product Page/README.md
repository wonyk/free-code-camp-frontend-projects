## Product Landing Page

This is a product landing page made for 'A Pencil & Pen' which is an imagined product.

It has fulfilled the requirements as stated in the user stories in [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/)

## About

As explained in the web page, the logo is made uniquely using simple basic online editing as well as the Papyrus font in Microsoft Words 2016.

It is inspired by a [Reddit Showerthought](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/c7u34t/a_capitalised_a_looks_like_the_sharpened_end_of_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) in r/Showerthoughts by u/Momo213213.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you w3schools and MDN for once again living up to your name being one of the best and most user-friendly platform to learn basic HTML and CSS which made this project possible.

Also, CSS Tricks is also my go-to place for quick CSS reference.

Next, I would like to credit [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) for their wonderful icons.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 59+, Chrome 75+, Edge 44+, IE 10 and above (in terms of css and form native build-in validation).

However, IE 9 and below are tested to be broken.

Note: The CSS has a theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
