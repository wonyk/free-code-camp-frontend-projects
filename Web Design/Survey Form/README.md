## Survey Form on Javascript Frameworks

This is a survey form built to gather opinions regarding the most popular Javascript frameworks today. 
It has fulfilled all the requirements of the assignment in [Free Code Camp Survey Form task](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides as well as recaps during the creation of this form.

Also, I would like to thank Christian Robertson for the wonderful and beautiful Roboto font hosted by Google Fonts.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 58+, Chrome 75+, Edge 44+, IE 10 and above (in terms of css and form native build-in validation).

The CSS has a theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
