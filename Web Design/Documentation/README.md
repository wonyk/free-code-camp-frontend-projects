## Python 3 Docs

After hours of choosing the right topic for the FCC assignment, I have decided to choose Python 3. This is because I have heard a lot about Python but does not have the chance to learn it.

It has fulfilled all the requirements of the assignment in [Free Code Camp Technical Documentation task](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides.

Also, I would like to thank Steve Matteson for the wonderful Open Sans font hosted by Google Fonts.

Next, thanks to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/), [LeanPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) and the [Official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Without them, this is definitely not possible.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 59+ (beta), Chrome 75+, Edge 44+ and above (in terms of css).

For the use of Javascript, I have no plans to add contingency when users disable Javascript. Thus, there is no `<noscript>` tags.

The CSS has a theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

However, IE is not supported at all. There is an issue with the use of svg images in IE, thus I am dropping support for IE fully.

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
