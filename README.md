## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank MDN and w3schools for the helpful HTML and CSS guides.

Also, I would like to thank Steve Matteson for the wonderful Open Sans font as well as ≈Åukasz Dziedzic for the beautiful matching Lato font, both of which are hosted on Google Fonts.

Next, thanks to [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Without it, this is definitely not possible.

Furthermore, thanks to [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) for the attractive looking Open Sourced icons.

Lastly, kudos to [CSS Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) for adding CSS support to older browsers.

## Supported Browsers

Tested working on Firefox 74.0+ (beta), Chrome 80+, Edge 44+, IE 11 and above (in terms of css).

The CSS has a theoretical support of the 'last 4 versions' on [browserl.ist](https://browserl.ist/?q=last%204%20versions).

For IE9 to IE10, the basic functionalities of displaying the titles, images and links are working. However, the CSS does not seem to be loading properly. There is an issue with the loading of Ionicons and flexbox in IE 10 and below.

The information is correct as of the latest commit. Should there be any discrepencies, please contact me for further arrangements.
